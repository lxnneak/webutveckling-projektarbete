                    <p>Super glad to see so much engagement in the subreddit since the AMAZING CB dropped and I'm so
                        happy that old and new birds are here in the nest. That being said, we do not know where the
                        mods are for the sub, so please try to stick to the post rules (Use the correct Flairs, title
                        rules etc.) until they return.
